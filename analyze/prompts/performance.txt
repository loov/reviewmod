## Performance Review Checklist
Look for:
- Unnecessary memory allocations in hot paths
- String concatenation in loops (use strings.Builder)
- Repeated slice appends without capacity hint
- Maps without size hint when size is known
- Unnecessary copies of large structs (pass by pointer)
- Reflection usage in performance-critical code
- Regular expression compilation inside loops
- Unnecessary type conversions
- Missing buffer reuse (consider sync.Pool)
- Inefficient slice operations (append in middle, repeated reslicing)
- Unbounded memory growth (slices that only grow)

Only report actual performance issues. If no issues found, return {"issues": []}.
