## Logging Review Checklist
Look for:
- Errors logged without context (wrap with fmt.Errorf)
- Inconsistent log levels (debug vs info vs warn)
- Sensitive data in logs (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Missing structured logging fields
- Printf-style logging instead of structured logging
- Missing request/trace IDs for correlation
- Log messages that don't help debugging
- Missing metrics for important operations
- No logging on error paths
- Excessive logging in hot paths (performance impact)
- Swallowed errors (caught but not logged or returned)
- Missing latency/duration tracking for operations

Only report actual logging/observability issues. If no issues found, return {"issues": []}.
