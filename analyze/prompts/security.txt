## Security Review Checklist
Look for these vulnerability categories:
- SQL Injection: Unparameterized queries, string concatenation in SQL
- Command Injection: Shell commands with user input, exec calls
- Path Traversal: File operations with user-controlled paths, missing sanitization
- XSS: Unescaped output in HTML contexts
- SSRF: User-controlled URLs in HTTP requests
- Insecure Deserialization: Untrusted data in unmarshal calls
- Hardcoded Secrets: API keys, passwords, tokens in code
- Weak Cryptography: Insecure algorithms, weak random sources
- Race Conditions: Unsynchronized access to shared state
- Information Disclosure: Sensitive data in logs or errors

Only report actual security issues. If no issues found, return {"issues": []}.
