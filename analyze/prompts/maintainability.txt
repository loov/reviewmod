## Maintainability Review Checklist

Complexity:
- Functions longer than 50 lines
- Deep nesting (more than 3 levels)
- Functions with more than 5 parameters
- Complex boolean expressions
- Multiple responsibilities in one function

Readability:
- Magic numbers without named constants
- Unclear variable or function names
- Complex logic without explanatory comments
- Inconsistent naming conventions

API Design (exported functions only):
- Exported functions without documentation
- Too many parameters (consider options struct)
- Boolean parameters that reduce readability

Only report significant maintainability issues. Ignore minor style preferences.
Use severity "minor" for suggestions, "important" for real maintainability problems.
If no issues found, return {"issues": []}.
