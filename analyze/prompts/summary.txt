You are analyzing a Go function to create a summary of its behavior.
{{template "function-context" .}}
{{- template "callees-context" .}}

Analyze this function and respond with JSON in this exact format:
{
  "purpose": "One sentence describing what this function does",
  "behavior": "How it behaves - side effects, return conditions, error cases",
  "invariants": ["preconditions", "postconditions", "guarantees"],
  "security": ["security-relevant properties for callers to know"]
}

Be precise and concise. Focus on what callers need to know.
