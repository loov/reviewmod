## Testability Review Checklist
Look for:
- Global state that makes testing difficult
- Hardcoded dependencies (consider dependency injection)
- Time.Now() calls (inject clock interface)
- Direct file system access (inject fs interface)
- Network calls without abstraction (inject client interface)
- Random number generation without seed control
- Functions that are impossible to unit test in isolation
- Missing error paths that should be tested
- Complex conditionals that need table-driven tests
- Side effects mixed with pure computation
- init() functions with complex logic
- Package-level variables that hold state

Only report actual testability issues. If no issues found, return {"issues": []}.
