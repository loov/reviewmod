## Correctness Review Checklist

Error Handling:
- Ignored errors (assigned to _ or not checked)
- Missing error wrapping (use fmt.Errorf with %w)
- Panic for recoverable errors
- Error shadowing in inner scopes

Nil and Bounds Safety:
- Nil pointer dereference without check
- Slice/array access without bounds check
- Map access assuming key exists when it might not
- Type assertions without ok check

Resource Management:
- Unclosed files, connections, or response bodies
- Missing defer for cleanup
- defer in loops (accumulates until function returns)
- Resources not released on error paths
- Context cancellation not checked in long operations
- Missing timeouts on network operations

Only report actual correctness bugs. If no issues found, return {"issues": []}.
