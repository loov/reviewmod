## Complexity Review Checklist
Look for:
- Functions longer than 50 lines
- Cyclomatic complexity above 10 (many branches/loops)
- Deeply nested code (more than 3 levels)
- Functions with more than 5 parameters
- Functions with more than 3 return values
- Complex boolean expressions
- Long switch statements that could be maps
- Multiple responsibilities in one function
- Complex control flow (goto, labeled breaks)
- Functions that are hard to understand at a glance
- God functions that do everything
- Repeated similar code blocks (extract to helper)
- Long parameter lists of same type (easy to swap)

Only report actual complexity issues. If no issues found, return {"issues": []}.
