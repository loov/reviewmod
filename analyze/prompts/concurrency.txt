## Concurrency Review Checklist
Look for:
- Race conditions on shared state without synchronization
- Goroutine leaks (goroutines that never terminate)
- Missing mutex locks or unlocks
- Deadlock potential from lock ordering
- Channel misuse (send on closed channel, nil channel operations)
- Missing select default cases causing blocking
- Improper use of sync.WaitGroup (Add after Wait, wrong count)
- Context cancellation not checked in long operations
- Shared state modified in goroutines without protection
- sync.Mutex copied by value

Only report actual concurrency issues. If no issues found, return {"issues": []}.
