## API Design Review Checklist
Look for:
- Exported functions without documentation
- Inconsistent naming (mixedCase vs under_score, abbreviations)
- Too many parameters (consider options struct)
- Returning concrete types instead of interfaces
- Overly broad interfaces (accept interfaces, return structs)
- Boolean parameters that reduce readability
- Functions that do too many things (violate single responsibility)
- Unclear return value semantics (when is error nil?)
- Missing error types for distinguishable errors
- Context not as first parameter when needed
- Unexported types in exported function signatures
- Stutter in names (package user with func UserNew)

Only report actual API design issues. If no issues found, return {"issues": []}.
