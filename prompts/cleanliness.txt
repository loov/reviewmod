## Code Cleanliness Review Checklist
Look for these issues:
- Long Functions: Functions exceeding 50-60 lines that should be split
- Too Many Parameters: Functions with more than 4-5 parameters
- Deep Nesting: More than 3 levels of indentation
- Magic Numbers: Unexplained numeric literals
- Poor Naming: Unclear variable or function names
- Code Duplication: Repeated logic that could be extracted
- Complex Conditionals: Boolean expressions that are hard to understand
- Missing Comments: Complex logic without explanatory comments
- Unused Code: Dead code, unused variables or parameters
- Inconsistent Style: Mixed naming conventions or formatting

Note: This is NOT a security or error handling review. Focus only on code quality and maintainability.
Only report actual cleanliness issues. If no issues found, return {"issues": []}.
Use severity "minor" for style suggestions, "important" for maintainability concerns.
